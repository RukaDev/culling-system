# Getting Started

## Installation

To install, download the latest `rbxm` source file in the [relases](https://github.com/rukadev/cyclone/releases) page.

---

## Setup

Once openend, place the `Cyclone` asset inside of **Replicated Storage**. Cyclone is ran client-side exclusively, so to test it out in-game, create a local script under **StarterPlayerScripts** inside of **StarterPlayer**.

---

## Modes

When using cyclone, there are 3 modes available at your disposal to configure based on your need.

:::caution
`Lazy` and `Zone` are currenlty still under development.
:::

### `DejaVu`

Dependent on the data output generated from [DejaVu Editor](https://github.com).

### `Lazy`

Provides flexibility to freely place items anywhere in the **workspace** for the most seamless transition into an existing game.

### `Zone`

Allows for 'close', 'medium' and 'far' range configuration for each user-defined zone. This is a good inbetween between the `lazy` and `Dejavu` methods.
