# Cyclone

Cyclone is a culling system for dynamically rendering objects in 3D space according to proximity. Cyclone features a broad serach to instantiate objects, and a narrow search to define level of detail for theses instantiated objects.

## Goals

* Allow for seamless integration to any project by introducing different modes.

* Provide a performant solution to large-scale maps by reducing memory.

* Encourage ambitious projects without fear of performance implications. 

## Non-goals

* Providing performance relief for dense areas.

* Compatability with randomly generated maps.
